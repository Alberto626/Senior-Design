VR Game Senior Design Project - README
## Introduction
Welcome to our Senior Design Project, a virtual reality (VR) game developed using Unity. This README file provides an overview of the project, its features, installation instructions, and important considerations. We hope you find this document helpful and informative.

## Project Description
Our senior design project focuses on developing an immersive VR game that provides an exciting and engaging experience for players. The game combines virtual reality technology, Unity game engine, and interactive gameplay mechanics to create a unique and enjoyable gaming experience.

## Key Features
Immersive VR Environment: The game takes full advantage of VR technology, allowing players to explore a visually stunning and immersive virtual environment.

Unique Gameplay Mechanics: We have implemented innovative gameplay mechanics that utilize VR interactions, enabling players to interact with objects, solve puzzles, and overcome challenges within the game world.

Multiple Game Modes: The game offers different modes to cater to various player preferences, including story mode, time attack mode, and multiplayer mode.

Intuitive Controls: The game incorporates intuitive controls optimized for VR, ensuring that players can easily navigate and interact with the virtual environment.

## Installation Instructions
To play our VR game, follow these installation instructions:

1. System Requirements: Ensure that your computer meets the minimum system requirements for running VR applications. Tested and used with Occulus Quest 2, a powerful enough GPU, and sufficient RAM.

2. Unity Installation: Download and install the latest version of Unity from the official Unity website (https://unity.com/).

3. Project Setup:

* Clone or download the project files from our GitHub repository:
* Open Unity and select "Open Project." Navigate to the project folder and select it to open the project.
4. Asset Import: Unity will automatically import the project assets. However, if any assets are missing, manually import them into the project from the appropriate directories.

5. Build and Run: Connect your VR headset to your computer and configure it according to the manufacturer's instructions. Once set up, build the project and run it in Unity to test the game in the VR environment.

6. Controls: Familiarize yourself with the control scheme provided within the game. Ensure that the VR controllers are properly calibrated and functioning correctly.

Important Considerations
Hardware Limitations: Depending on the specifications of your computer and VR headset, the game's performance may vary. Adjust graphical settings and optimize performance for the best experience.

Health and Safety: When using VR technology, take regular breaks to avoid discomfort, eye strain, or motion sickness. Follow the guidelines provided by the VR headset manufacturer for safe usage.

## Conclusion
Thank you for your interest in our Senior Design Project! We hope you enjoy playing our VR game and have a fantastic immersive experience. Should you have any questions or encounter any issues, please reach out to our team for assistance. Happy gaming!
